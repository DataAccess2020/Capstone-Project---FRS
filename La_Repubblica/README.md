# Capstone-Project---FRS
Final Assignment - team Fabiana, Riccardo e Sofia 

This is the repository for the final assingment of the course Data Access. We are three students from the University of Milan we are enrolled in a two year MA in Data Analytics (for short, DAPS&CO). 

The goal of this reasearch is to practice our coding skills, in particular regarding scraping HTTP web pages. We are focusing our work on three international journals (..), in order to understand what is the general sentiment of the headline news and their differences. 

We will devide our task in points:
- Scraping
- Pre-processing the obtained data
- Text-analysis
- Sentiment analysis
- Reporting the results in a meaningful way

We will update this Read.me file during the course of the assignment. We hope you find this work interesting. 

Riccardo, Sofia, Fabiana
